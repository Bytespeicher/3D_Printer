## 3D_Printer
==========

Both the 3D printer development itself + printed parts and projects

We own a FELIX 1.5 printer. 

### To add a printing projekt, 

1. clone this repo, 
2. add a new folder, named after your project
3. add a README.md into that folder describing your project
4. add the .stl file with your model (and use versioning for the devlopment) (commit often, the diff looks cool!)
5. (Optional) Add the .gcode file for fast reproduction
6. add pictures/videos of the print process and the finished part
7. push here (if you have the rights) or send a pull request

Optional: Please add a description of encountered problems, funny stories, repairs or modifications to the printer to the readme should they happen during your project.

### The usual structure is:
- `name_of_your_project/`  
    - *should contain a README.md*  
- `name_of_your_project/models`  
    - *for 3D model files in various formats*  
- `name_of_your_project/images`  
    - *for photos documenting the design, build and test process*  
- `name_of_your_project/references`  
    - *for reference files like 2D-drawings, CAD-files, reference photos etc.*
