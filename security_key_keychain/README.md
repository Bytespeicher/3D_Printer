##Keychain extension for FIDO U2F Security Keys

This should fit the cheap 5 â‚¬ U2F security key snuggly and make it a bit more 
resistant to physical stress. 

The key can be found on Amazon: http://www.amazon.de/Plug-up-FIDO-U2F-U2F-SK-01-Security/dp/B00OGPO3ZS

### Notes:
* uses the existing hole in the key to provide secure it in place
* needs a little glue to hold both parts together
  * alternative could be to make the holding cones longer and using them like 
    rivets with a hot air gun
  * Update: longer pins as rivets work like a charm
