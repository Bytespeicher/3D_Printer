## GoGorilla adapter

- for fixing a well-known brand of action camera to a well-known brand of bendable camera tripods
- this is for the old type of tripods without the rotateable head

### Version 1 

- uploaded reference photos of the original adapters
- extracted lines from photos
- measured original devices for reference
- re-modelled base of tripod mount and top of camera mount in SketchUp

Notes: 
- First try with holes and fittings in original size without any addition for shrinking
- Used [CleanUp3](http://extensions.sketchup.com/de/content/cleanup%C2%B3) and [SolidInspector](http://extensions.sketchup.com/en/content/solid-inspector) plugins for SketchUp to find manifold errors.
- Had to flip some faces manually to fix the github preview of the stl.
