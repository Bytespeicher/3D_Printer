## Lens Cap Holder

- for fixing 48mm or 62mm lens caps to strap of your camera bag/rucksack
- should work for straps up to 50mm wide

### Version 1 (not uploaded)

- designed in blender
- had nice bumby ridges to hold the caps, but failed the STL import check hopelessly

### Version 2

- designed in Sketchup
- now almost passes the import check, but slicing seems to work nevertheless
- printing did not work due to failing first layer (non-planar? dirty nozzle?)
